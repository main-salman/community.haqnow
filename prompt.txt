New prompt:
User should be able to redact PDF documents. All documents that are uploaded should turn into PDFs, including images. All documents that are uploaded should be OCR. The documents that are not in English should be translated to English. User should be able to redact documents using GUI and export sections of the document in PDF VIA GUI. Users should be able to ask questions about the document using AI (with RAG and Ollama behind the scenes) and also be able to search documents by words and phrases. Implement and test all of these features and ask me 10 questions before proceeding.

Prompt for cursor:
	- Create a platform called community.haqnow.com
		○ Users should be able to upload hundreds or thousands of documents at once
		○ User should be able to search them by words in the document
		○ Users should be able to use AI to ask questions about the documents
		○ Administrator should be able to add remove users. Users should use MFA.
		○ Uploaded documents should be OCR and translated to English if they're not in English
		○ Users should be able to make notes or add comments on the documents online
		○ You shares should also be able to easily redact portions of the document and export portions of the documents as PDF
		○ The uploaded documents should be stripped of metadata, regardless of which format the document is uploaded in
		○ User should be able to edit the documents live together and be able to see the changes two documents live together
		○ User should be able to highlight sections of the document
		○ User should be able to add tags to documents and then search documents by tags as well
		○ Some of the required features can be re-used from https://github.com/main-salman/haqnow - although that will remain a separate project
		○ Deploy to the same account as https://github.com/main-salman/haqnow but use a new server and new Exoscale bucket - build the underlying infrastructure required
Use .env file - that has credentials for exoscale to build infrastructure - use https://github.com/main-salman/haqnow as a template for deploying the infrastructure as well


I'm going to take a quick scan of the current app (backend, static site, deploy script, and history) so I can anchor the revamp plan to what's already here, then I'll ask 10 focused questions before building as requested.

I scanned the backend, static site, and deploy script to understand the current baseline. Before building, I'll record the revamp intent and 10 questions in `history.txt`, then ask you here to unblock implementation.

I logged the revamp plan and 10 confirmation questions into `history.txt`. Next, I’ll present those questions here so you can answer; after your answers, I’ll proceed to implementation.

### Revamp approach: Seafile core + required features
We’ll base storage/sync and collaboration on Seafile’s server stack and extend with OCR, translation, redaction, tagging, search, and AI Q&A. Reference: Seafile repositories: daemon, server core, and web UI [haiwen/seafile](`https://github.com/haiwen/seafile`). We’ll deploy Seafile in your Exoscale environment, integrate auth/MFA, and expose custom APIs/UI to satisfy `prompt.txt`.

### 10 confirmations before building
Please answer briefly per item:

1) Seafile deployment model
- Full Seafile (server + Seahub) managed by us, with our app extending it, or headless Seafile with a custom-only web app? Recommended: full Seafile for easier upgrades.

2) Object storage on Exoscale
- Use Exoscale SOS (S3-compatible) as Seafile backend? Confirm bucket name, zone, and whether to reuse `.env` credentials.

3) Auth and MFA source of truth
- Use Seafile accounts/MFA/SSO as canonical and SSO our custom app into it, replacing current JWT? Or keep current auth and sync users into Seafile? Recommended: Seafile canonical.

4) Roles and permissions
- Confirm roles Admin/Editor/Viewer. Any group-based sharing beyond single-tenant org? Map to Seafile system admin/library owner/read-write/read-only.

5) Bulk ingestion workflow
- Background queued processing with progress/status and notifications ok? Max single file size and typical batch size?

6) Office docs handling
- Convert Office files to PDF for OCR/indexing on ingest (via headless LibreOffice) while preserving originals? Strip metadata on derivatives only?

7) Search stack
- Seafile’s native search vs external (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch). Want hybrid (keyword + semantic vectors) now or later?

8) AI Q&A constraints
- Confirm “local only” LLM and target model/hardware. Require citations/snippets and confidence in answers? Any PII guardrails?

9) Collaboration scope
- Is Markdown/Wiki-style coauthoring + PDF/image annotations/highlights sufficient, or do you need Google-Docs-style live coediting of Office/PDF content?

10) Redaction/export/audit
- Burn-in redactions on derived PDFs; originals preserved. Store derivatives alongside originals? Need audit logs and retention now or in a later phase?

Once you confirm, I’ll:
- Provision Seafile with Exoscale SOS
- Integrate unified auth/MFA
- Implement ingestion (OCR/translate/metadata strip), tagging, notes
- Add redaction/export
- Add search and AI Q&A endpoints with citations

- Added a dated entry to `history.txt` capturing the Seafile-based revamp plan and the 10 questions, without deleting prior history.


1. full 2. yes use Exoscale SOS - create a new bucket and deploy using terraform @terraform/ 3. use seafile auth 4. use seafile system 5. use seafile defaults 6. yes and yes 7. native search + semantic vectors 8. local only 9. google style co-editing with all the features defined in @prompt.txt  10. burn-in redactions on derived PDFs. No audit logs.
